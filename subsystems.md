# Subsystems

Subsystems allow you to seperate various pieces of your project into logical and reusable parts. Subsystems contain any number of Services, Elements, Views, StateMachines ..etc 

For each subsystem in the designer uFrame generates a [system loader](system-loaders) class used to setup uFrame Runtime with any dependencies it might need before the game begins. 

## File structure

Data of each subsystem is held in a folder with the same name as the name of the subsystem.
