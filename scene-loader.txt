# Scene Loader

For each [Scene Type](scene-type) there is a scene loader class generated. For example, `LevelScene` scene type will have a corresponding `LevelSceneLoader` class.

```
public class LevelSceneLoader : LevelSceneLoaderBase { }
```

Scene loader is called right after the Unity scene with a [Scene Type](scene-types) MonoBehaviour attached is loaded.

The process of loading a scene with Unity's `LoadSceneAdditive()` is called _Instantiation_.
