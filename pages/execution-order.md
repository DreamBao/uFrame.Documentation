# Execution Order

Each scene that is handled by uFrame has a [Scene Type](scene-types.md) script attached to the root game object. When you enter play mode, it'll load the kernel and execute any additional code that you've added to the scene class.

You can read more about how the kernel is loaded or about execution order of other uFrame components in their respective pages.

## Scenarios

This section will describe execution order for multiple example scenarios.
